## Context

Researcher performed a biological assay which produced a data set that labels DNA sequences with protein binding properties.

The researcher seeks a model that can learn to identify whether an new  DNA sequence contains similar binding properties.

A data scientist has been engaged to help develop a model.

A developer has also bee engaged to facilitate software development and data handling.

The following framework project has been setup:

 - A Cloud Pak For Data / Watson Studio project called HIMS2020-bioinformatics.

 - Researcher, Data Scientist, Develoer, and  Practitioner roles have been defined for the project. these are used to control access rights.

 -  An IBM Cloud Object Storage instance has been established to house the assay data and results of 
    the model development efforts. A knowledge catalog is also in place to govern access to the data assets.

Our researcher, data scientist, developer have been defined to the project per their roles and are also authorized to access 
the catalog and object storage.r

The general process that will unfold is as follows:
