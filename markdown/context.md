## Context

Researcher performed a biological assay which produced a data set that labels DNA sequence data protein binding properties.

The researcher seeks a model that can learn to identify whether an new sequence contains similar binding properties.

A data scientist has been engaged to help develop a model.

A developer has also bee engaged to facilitate software development and data handling.

The following framework project has been setup:

A Cloud Pak For Data / Watson Studio project called HIMS2020-bioinformatics.

Researcher, Data Scientist, Develoer, and  Practitioner Roles have been defined with appropriate access rights.

An IBM Cloud Object Storage instance has also been established to house the assay data and results of 
the model development efforts. A knowledge catalog is also in place to govern access to the data assets.

Our researcher, data scientist, developer have been defined to the project and been authorized to access 
the catalog and object storage.

The general process that will unfold is as follows:
